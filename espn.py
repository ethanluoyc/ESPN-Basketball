"""
This is my simple library to scrape NBA and NCB play-by-play information from
ESPN. I needed a small project to test out BeautifulSoup Alpha 4, so I felt
this was a good opportunity to refine some earlier code I had written.

In order to use this, you will need to download bs4 and also lxml (bs4 is
modular and can use both lxml and html5lib as back-end parsers).

The output is in dictionary format and contains the following information for
each individual play: quarter, quarter_time, overall_time, home_score,
away_score, home_play, away_play, and official_play (for timeouts, starts of
quarters, etc). I've found the majority of games normally have around 400 to
460 plays.
